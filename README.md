# Inquire

This is a reference application for using PayPal's Mobile Platform Library for the iPhone
SDK. The iOS directory contains the source for the iPhone application and GAE contains the
source for the server-side piece intended to run on Google App Engine. See the README files
in those two directories for information on each piece of the Inquire project.
